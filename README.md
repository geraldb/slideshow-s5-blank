## Intro

The [S5 Blank](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/) package bundled up into
a Slide Show (S9) template pack that lets you author your slides
in a wiki-style markup language (that is, Markdown or Textile) plus
lets you use text filters and helpers for adding comments, macros,
includes, syntax highlighters and much more.


Note, the S5 blank package is configured to use
the following headers in `slides.html`:

    author: Your Name Here
    company: Your Company Here
    title: Your Slide Show Title Here
    subtitle: Your Subtitle Here
    footer: Your Footer Here
    subfooter: Your Subfooter Here

If you want to try it yourself, install (fetch) the new template pack. Issue the command:

Or as an alternative clone the template pack using `git`. Issue the commands:

    $ cd ~/.slideshow/templates
    $ git clone https://github.com/slideshow-templates/slideshow-s5-blank.git
